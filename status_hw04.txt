4. How much of the functionality did you complete?
Everything but the arithmetic.

5. Did you successfully deploy? If not, what's broken?
No, It can’t find the production folder. I’m pretty confused. Will hopefully get up soon.

6. How comfortable do you feel with Elixir now?
Kinda comfortable

7. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?

Arithmetic expression is pretty long and tedious. Would have preferred slightly more simpler, and perhaps more fun example. I can do it, but just didn’t have the time.

Also the deploy was not as strait forward as I thought it would. The instructions looked clear but it didn’t work.
